# VSCode.OSKeybindings.Windows

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredHappyface/VSCode.OSKeybindings/master/windowskeybindings/Windows.png" alt="Project Icon" width="100">

Use Windows Keybindings on any OS

This extension does not remove any existing bindings. On the same os as that of
the keybindings that means everything will be bound twice. On other OS' that
means that the keybindings will be in addition to the default (note that they
take precedence over the default bindings)

Take a look at https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension
to get started.

## Issues/ Conflicts

There are some known issues and conflicts with other keybinding extensions.
Currently, this is best fixed manually - see

- https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/issues/396
- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/39888

Here is a list of those that I have suffered from. Follow the links and copy the
contents of the file into your keybindings json file. Note that I'll add these
to the extension at some point:
